## Reflection
I started this project with the objective of familiarising myself with firebase's database and file storage features.
I also wanted to archive my own methodology in case I wish to reflect upon this in the future. 

The application has three main features, 

    1) Loginging in with Google / registering a username and password
    2) Realtime text and image messaging 
    3) File storage upload

All these features where built using firebase's API.
